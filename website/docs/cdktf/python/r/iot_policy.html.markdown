# Resource: aws_iot_policy

Provides an IoT policy.

~> **NOTE on policy versions:** Updating this resource creates a new, default policy version. If updating the resource would exceed the maximum number of versions (5), the oldest non-default version of the policy is deleted before the new policy version is created.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.iot_policy import IotPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        IotPolicy(self, "pubsub",
            name="PubSubToAnyTopic",
            policy=Token.as_string(
                Fn.jsonencode({
                    "Statement": [{
                        "Action": ["iot:*"],
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Resource": "*"
                    }
                    ],
                    "Version": "2012-10-17"
                }))
        )
```

## Attribute Reference

* `policy` - The policy document.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `update` - (Default `1m`)
* `delete` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IoT policies using the `name`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

Using `terraform import`, import IoT policies using the `name`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_iot_policy.pubsub PubSubToAnyTopic
```
