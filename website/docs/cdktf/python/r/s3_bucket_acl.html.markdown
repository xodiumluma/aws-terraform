# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_acl

Provides an S3 bucket ACL resource.

~> **Note:** `terraform destroy` does not delete the S3 Bucket ACL but does remove the resource from Terraform state.

## Example Usage

### With `private` ACL

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket import S3Bucket
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_acl import S3BucketAcl
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_ownership_controls import S3BucketOwnershipControls
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = S3Bucket(self, "example",
            bucket="my-tf-example-bucket"
        )
        aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls_example = S3BucketOwnershipControls(self, "example_1",
            bucket=example.id,
            rule=S3BucketOwnershipControlsRule(
                object_ownership="BucketOwnerPreferred"
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls_example.override_logical_id("example")
        aws_s3_bucket_acl_example = S3BucketAcl(self, "example_2",
            acl="private",
            bucket=example.id,
            depends_on=[aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls_example]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_s3_bucket_acl_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

### With `public-read` ACL

-> This example explicitly disables the default S3 bucket security settings. This
should be done with caution, as all bucket objects become publicly exposed.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket ACL using `bucket`, `expected_bucket_owner`, and/or `acl`, depending on your situation. For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket` and `acl` separated by a comma (`,`):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket`, `expected_bucket_owner`, and `acl` separated by commas (`,`):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** using `bucket`, `expected_bucket_owner`, and/or `acl`, depending on your situation. For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket` and `acl` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name,private
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name,123456789012
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket`, `expected_bucket_owner`, and `acl` separated by commas (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name,123456789012,private
```
