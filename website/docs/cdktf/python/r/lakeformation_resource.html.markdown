# Resource: aws_lakeformation_resource

Registers a Lake Formation resource (e.g., S3 bucket) as managed by the Data Catalog. In other words, the S3 path is added to the data lake.

Choose a role that has read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path or use the service-linked role. When you register the S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_s3_bucket import DataAwsS3Bucket
from imports.aws.lakeformation_resource import LakeformationResource
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = DataAwsS3Bucket(self, "example",
            bucket="an-example-bucket"
        )
        aws_lakeformation_resource_example = LakeformationResource(self, "example_1",
            arn=Token.as_string(example.arn)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_lakeformation_resource_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

* `arn` – (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource, an S3 path.
* `role_arn` – (Optional) Role that has read/write access to the resource. If not provided, the Lake Formation service-linked role must exist and is used.

~> **NOTE:** AWS does not support registering an S3 location with an IAM role and subsequently updating the S3 location registration to a service-linked role.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `last_modified` - (Optional) The date and time the resource was last modified in [RFC 3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8).
