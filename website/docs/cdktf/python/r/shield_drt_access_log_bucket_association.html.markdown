from imports.aws.shield_drt_access_log_bucket_association import ShieldDrtAccessLogBucketAssociation
from imports.aws.shield_drt_access_role_arn_association import ShieldDrtAccessRoleArnAssociation
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = ShieldDrtAccessRoleArnAssociation(self, "test",
            role_arn="arn:aws:iam:${" + current.name + "}:${" + data_aws_caller_identity_current.account_id + "}:${" + shield_drt_access_role_name.value + "}"
        )
        aws_shield_drt_access_log_bucket_association_test =
        ShieldDrtAccessLogBucketAssociation(self, "test_1",
            log_bucket=shield_drt_access_log_bucket.string_value,
            role_arn_association_id=test.id
