# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration

Provides an S3 bucket request payment configuration resource. For more information, see [Requester Pays Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html).

~> **NOTE:** Destroying an `aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration` resource resets the bucket's `payer` to the S3 default: the bucket owner.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration import S3BucketRequestPaymentConfiguration
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        S3BucketRequestPaymentConfiguration(self, "example",
            bucket=Token.as_string(aws_s3_bucket_example.id),
            payer="Requester"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expected_bucket_owner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `payer` - (Required) Specifies who pays for the download and request fees. Valid values: `BucketOwner`, `Requester`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket request payment configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket request payment configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
