# Resource: aws_wafv2_web_acl

Creates a WAFv2 Web ACL resource.

~> **Note** In `fieldToMatch` blocks, _e.g._, in `byteMatchStatement`, the `body` block includes an optional argument `oversizeHandling`. AWS indicates this argument will be required starting February 2023. To avoid configurations breaking when that change happens, treat the `oversizeHandling` argument as **required** as soon as possible.

## Example Usage

This resource is based on `awsWafv2RuleGroup`, check the documentation of the `awsWafv2RuleGroup` resource to see examples of the various available statements.

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `associationConfig` - (Optional) Specifies custom configurations for the associations between the web ACL and protected resources. See [`association_config`](#association_config-block) below for details.
* `customResponseBody` - (Optional) Defines custom response bodies that can be referenced by `custom_response` actions. See [`custom_response_body`](#custom_response_body-block) below for details.
* `defaultAction` - (Required) Action to perform if none of the `rules` contained in the WebACL match. See [`default_action`](#default_action-block) below for details.
* `description` - (Optional) Friendly description of the WebACL.
* `name` - (Required) Friendly name of the WebACL.
* `rule` - (Optional) Rule blocks used to identify the web requests that you want to `allow`, `block`, or `count`. See [`rule`](#rule-block) below for details.
* `scope` - (Required) Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. Valid values are `CLOUDFRONT` or `REGIONAL`. To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the region `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) on the AWS provider.
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of key-value pairs to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `tokenDomains` - (Optional) Specifies the domains that AWS WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites. When AWS WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the AWS resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify a list of token domains, AWS WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, AWS WAF accepts the resource's host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains.
* `visibilityConfig` - (Required) Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection. See [`visibility_config`](#visibility_config-block) below for details.

### `associationConfig` Block

The `associationConfig` block supports the following arguments:

* `requestBody` - (Optional) Customizes the request body that your protected resource forward to AWS WAF for inspection. See [`request_body`](#request_body-block) below for details.

### `customResponseBody` Block

Each `customResponseBody` block supports the following arguments:

* `key` - (Required) Unique key identifying the custom response body. This is referenced by the `custom_response_body_key` argument in the [`custom_response`](#custom_response-block) block.
* `content` - (Required) Payload of the custom response.
* `contentType` - (Required) Type of content in the payload that you are defining in the `content` argument. Valid values are `TEXT_PLAIN`, `TEXT_HTML`, or `APPLICATION_JSON`.

### `defaultAction` Block

The `defaultAction` block supports the following arguments:

~> **Note** One of `allow` or `block`, expressed as an empty configuration block `{}`, is required when specifying a `defaultAction`

* `allow` - (Optional) Specifies that AWS WAF should allow requests by default. See [`allow`](#allow-block) below for details.
* `block` - (Optional) Specifies that AWS WAF should block requests by default. See [`block`](#block-block) below for details.

### `rule` Block

~> **Note** One of `action` or `overrideAction` is required when specifying a rule

Each `rule` supports the following arguments:

* `action` - (Optional) Action that AWS WAF should take on a web request when it matches the rule's statement. This is used only for rules whose **statements do not reference a rule group**. See [`action`](#action-block) for details.
* `captchaConfig` - (Optional) Specifies how AWS WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations. See [`captcha_config`](#captcha_config-block) below for details.
* `name` - (Required) Friendly name of the rule. Note that the provider assumes that rules with names matching this pattern, `^ShieldMitigationRuleGroup_<account-id>_<web-acl-guid>_.*`, are AWS-added for [automatic application layer DDoS mitigation activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-automatic-app-layer-response-rg.html). Such rules will be ignored by the provider unless you explicitly include them in your configuration (for example, by using the AWS CLI to discover their properties and creating matching configuration). However, since these rules are owned and managed by AWS, you may get permission errors.
* `overrideAction` - (Optional) Override action to apply to the rules in a rule group. Used only for rule **statements that reference a rule group**, like `rule_group_reference_statement` and `managed_rule_group_statement`. See [`override_action`](#override_action-block) below for details.
* `priority` - (Required) If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL, AWS WAF evaluates each request against the `rules` in order based on the value of `priority`. AWS WAF processes rules with lower priority first.
* `ruleLabel` - (Optional) Labels to apply to web requests that match the rule match statement. See [`rule_label`](#rule_label-block) below for details.
* `statement` - (Required) The AWS WAF processing statement for the rule, for example `byte_match_statement` or `geo_match_statement`. See [`statement`](#statement-block) below for details.
* `visibilityConfig` - (Required) Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection. See [`visibility_config`](#visibility_config-block) below for details.

### `action` Block

Only the first 8 KB of the request body are forwarded to WAF by the underlying host service. Valid values: `CONTINUE`, `MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`.

### `cookies` Block

Inspect the cookies in the web request. You can specify the parts of the cookies to inspect and you can narrow the set of cookies to inspect by including or excluding specific keys. This is used to indicate the web request component to inspect, in the [FieldToMatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_FieldToMatch.html) specification.

The `cookies` block supports the following arguments:

* `matchPattern` - (Required) The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.

The `cookie` block supports the following arguments:

* `name`: The name of the cookie to use.
* `textTransformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [`text_transformation`](#text_transformation-block) above for details.

### RateLimit `forwardedIp` Block

Use the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes to the aggregation instance.

The `httpMethod` block is configured as an empty block `{}`.

### RateLimit `header` Block

Use the value of a header in the request as an aggregate key. Each distinct value in the header contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single header as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.

The `header` block supports the following arguments:

* `name`: The name of the header to use.
* `textTransformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [`text_transformation`](#text_transformation-block) above for details.

You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `ip` in your rate-based statement's `aggregateKeyType`.

The `ip` block is configured as an empty block `{}`.

### RateLimit `labelNamespace` Block

Use the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance. This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL. For information about label namespaces and names, see Label syntax and naming requirements (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the WAF Developer Guide.

The `labelNamespace` block supports the following arguments:

* `namespace`: The namespace to use for aggregation
