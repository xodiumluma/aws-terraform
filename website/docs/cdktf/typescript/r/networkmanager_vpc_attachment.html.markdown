# Resource: aws_networkmanager_vpc_attachment

Terraform resource for managing an AWS NetworkManager VpcAttachment.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { NetworkmanagerVpcAttachment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/networkmanager-vpc-attachment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new NetworkmanagerVpcAttachment(this, "example", {
      coreNetworkId: Token.asString(awsccNetworkmanagerCoreNetworkExample.id),
      subnetArns: [Token.asString(awsSubnetExample.arn)],
      vpcArn: Token.asString(awsVpcExample.arn),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `coreNetworkId` - (Required) The ID of a core network for the VPC attachment.
* `subnetArns` - (Required) The subnet ARN of the VPC attachment.
* `vpcArn` - (Required) The ARN of the VPC.

The following arguments are optional:

* `options` - (Optional) Options for the VPC attachment.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value tags for the attachment. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### options

* `applianceModeSupport` - (Optional) Indicates whether appliance mode is supported. If enabled, traffic flow between a source and destination use the same Availability Zone for the VPC attachment for the lifetime of that flow.
* `ipv6Support` - (Optional) Indicates whether IPv6 is supported.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The ARN of the attachment.
* `attachmentPolicyRuleNumber` - The policy rule number associated with the attachment.
* `attachmentType` - The type of attachment.
* `coreNetworkArn` - The ARN of a core network.
* `edgeLocation` - The Region where the edge is located.
* `id` - The ID of the attachment.
* `ownerAccountId` - The ID of the attachment account owner.
* `resourceArn` - The attachment resource ARN.
* `segmentName` - The name of the segment attachment.
* `state` - The state of the attachment.
* `tagsAll` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachment` using the attachment ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `awsNetworkmanagerVpcAttachment` using the attachment ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_networkmanager_vpc_attachment.example attachment-0f8fa60d2238d1bd8
```
