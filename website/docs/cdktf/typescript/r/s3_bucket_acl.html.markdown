# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_acl

Provides an S3 bucket ACL resource.

~> **Note:** `terraform destroy` does not delete the S3 Bucket ACL but does remove the resource from Terraform state.

## Example Usage

### With `private` ACL

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";
import { S3BucketAcl } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-acl";
import { S3BucketOwnershipControls } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-ownership-controls";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new S3Bucket(this, "example", {
      bucket: "my-tf-example-bucket",
    });
    const awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample = new S3BucketOwnershipControls(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        bucket: example.id,
        rule: {
          objectOwnership: "BucketOwnerPreferred",
        },
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const awsS3BucketAclExample = new S3BucketAcl(this, "example_2", {
      acl: "private",
      bucket: example.id,
      dependsOn: [awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample],
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketAclExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

### With `publicRead` ACL

-> This example explicitly disables the default S3 bucket security settings. This
should be done with caution, as all bucket objects become publicly exposed.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";
import { S3BucketAcl } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-acl";
import { S3BucketOwnershipControls } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-ownership-controls";
import { S3BucketPublicAccessBlock } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-public-access-block";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new S3Bucket(this, "example", {
      bucket: "my-tf-example-bucket",
    });
    const awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample = new S3BucketOwnershipControls(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        bucket: example.id,
        rule: {
          objectOwnership: "BucketOwnerPreferred",
        },
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const awsS3BucketPublicAccessBlockExample = new S3BucketPublicAccessBlock(
      this,
      "example_2",
      {
        blockPublicAcls: false,
        blockPublicPolicy: false,
        bucket: example.id,
        ignorePublicAcls: false,
        restrictPublicBuckets: false,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketPublicAccessBlockExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const awsS3BucketAclExample = new S3BucketAcl(this, "example_3", {
      acl: "public-read",
      bucket: example.id,
      dependsOn: [
        awsS3BucketOwnershipControlsExample,
        awsS3BucketPublicAccessBlockExample,
      ],
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsS3BucketAclExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket ACL using `bucket`, `expectedBucketOwner`, and/or `acl`, depending on your situation. For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket` and `acl` separated by a comma (`,`):

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket`, `expectedBucketOwner`, and `acl` separated by commas (`,`):

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

**Using `terraform import` to import** using `bucket`, `expectedBucketOwner`, and/or `acl`, depending on your situation. For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a
[canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the _same_ account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), import using the `bucket` and `acl` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name,private
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **not configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name,123456789012
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket _differs_ from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, and the source bucket is **configured** with a [canned ACL][1] (i.e. predefined grant), imported using the `bucket`, `expectedBucketOwner`, and `acl` separated by commas (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example bucket-name,123456789012,private
```
