# Resource: aws_detective_organization_configuration

Manages the Detective Organization Configuration in the current AWS Region. The AWS account utilizing this resource must have been assigned as a delegated Organization administrator account, e.g., via the [`awsDetectiveOrganizationAdminAccount` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/detective_organization_admin_account.html). More information about Organizations support in Detective can be found in the [Detective User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/accounts-orgs-transition.html).

~> **NOTE:** This is an advanced Terraform resource. Terraform will automatically assume management of the Detective Organization Configuration without import and perform no actions on removal from the Terraform configuration.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DetectiveGraph } from "./.gen/providers/aws/detective-graph";
import { DetectiveOrganizationConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/detective-organization-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new DetectiveGraph(this, "example", {
      enable: true,
    });
    const awsDetectiveOrganizationConfigurationExample =
      new DetectiveOrganizationConfiguration(this, "example_1", {
        autoEnable: true,
        graphArn: example.id,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsDetectiveOrganizationConfigurationExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `autoEnable` - (Required) When this setting is enabled, all new accounts that are created in, or added to, the organization are added as a member accounts of the organizationâ€™s Detective delegated administrator and Detective is enabled in that AWS Region.
* `graphArn` - (Required) ARN of the behavior graph.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - Identifier of the Detective Graph.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `awsDetectiveOrganizationAdminAccount` using the Detective Graph ID. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import `awsDetectiveOrganizationAdminAccount` using the Detective Graph ID. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_detective_organization_configuration.example 00b00fd5aecc0ab60a708659477e9617
```
