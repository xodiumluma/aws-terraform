## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the connector.
* `version` - The current version of the connector.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `20m`)
* `update` - (Default `20m`)
* `delete` - (Default `10m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import MSK Connect Connector using the connector's `arn`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import MSK Connect Connector using the connector's `arn`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_mskconnect_connector.example 'arn:aws:kafkaconnect:eu-central-1:123456789012:connector/example/264edee4-17a3-412e-bd76-6681cfc93805-3'
```
