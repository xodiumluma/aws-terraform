# Resource: aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration

Provides an S3 bucket request payment configuration resource. For more information, see [Requester Pays Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html).

~> **NOTE:** Destroying an `awsS3BucketRequestPaymentConfiguration` resource resets the bucket's `payer` to the S3 default: the bucket owner.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { S3BucketRequestPaymentConfiguration } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-request-payment-configuration";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new S3BucketRequestPaymentConfiguration(this, "example", {
      bucket: Token.asString(awsS3BucketExample.id),
      payer: "Requester",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `bucket` - (Required, Forces new resource) Name of the bucket.
* `expectedBucketOwner` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Account ID of the expected bucket owner.
* `payer` - (Required) Specifies who pays for the download and request fees. Valid values: `BucketOwner`, `Requester`.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `id` - The `bucket` or `bucket` and `expected_bucket_owner` separated by a comma (`,`) if the latter is provided.

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket request payment configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

**Using `terraform import` to import** S3 bucket request payment configuration using the `bucket` or using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`). For example:

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket is the same account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket`:

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration.example bucket-name
```

If the owner (account ID) of the source bucket differs from the account used to configure the Terraform AWS Provider, import using the `bucket` and `expectedBucketOwner` separated by a comma (`,`):

```console
% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_request_payment_configuration.example bucket-name,123456789012
```
