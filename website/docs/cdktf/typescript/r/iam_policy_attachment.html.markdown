# Resource: aws_iam_policy_attachment

Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to user(s), role(s), and/or group(s)

!> **WARNING:** The aws_iam_policy_attachment resource creates **exclusive** attachments of IAM policies. Across the entire AWS account, all of the users/roles/groups to which a single policy is attached must be declared by a single aws_iam_policy_attachment resource. This means that even any users/roles/groups that have the attached policy via any other mechanism (including other Terraform resources) will have that attached policy revoked by this resource. Consider `awsIamRolePolicyAttachment`, `awsIamUserPolicyAttachment`, or `awsIamGroupPolicyAttachment` instead. These resources do not enforce exclusive attachment of an IAM policy.

~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `awsIamGroupPolicyAttachment`, `awsIamRolePolicyAttachment`, and `awsIamUserPolicyAttachment` resources and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.

~> **NOTE:** For a given role, this resource is incompatible with using the [`awsIamRole` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_role.html) `managedPolicyArns` argument. When using that argument and this resource, both will attempt to manage the role's managed policy attachments and Terraform will show a permanent difference.

## Example Usage

```typescript

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

    super(scope, name);
    const group = new IamGroup(this, "group", {
      name: "test-group",
    });
    const user = new IamUser(this, "user", {
      name: "test-user",
    });
    const assumeRole = new DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "assume_role", {
      statement: [
        {
          actions: ["sts:AssumeRole"],
          effect: "Allow",
          principals: [

              type: "Service",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });
    const policy = new DataAwsIamPolicyDocument(this, "policy", {
      statement: [
        {
          actions: ["ec2:Describe*"],
          effect: "Allow",
          resources: ["*"],
        },
      ],
    });
    const awsIamPolicyPolicy = new IamPolicy(this, "policy_4", {
      description: "A test policy",
      name: "test-policy",
      policy: Token.asString(policy.json),
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsIamPolicyPolicy.overrideLogicalId("policy");
    const role = new IamRole(this, "role", {
      assumeRolePolicy: Token.asString(assumeRole.json),
      name: "test-role",
    });
    new IamPolicyAttachment(this, "test-attach", {
      groups: [group.name],
      name: "test-attachment",
      policyArn: Token.asString(awsIamPolicyPolicy.arn),
      roles: [role.name],
      users: [user.name],
    });
  }
}

```
