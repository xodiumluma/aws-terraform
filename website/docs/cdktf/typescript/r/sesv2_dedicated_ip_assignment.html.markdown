# Resource: aws_sesv2_dedicated_ip_assignment

Terraform resource for managing an AWS SESv2 (Simple Email V2) Dedicated IP Assignment.

This resource is used with "Standard" dedicated IP addresses. This includes addresses [requested and relinquished manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/dedicated-ip-case.html) via an AWS support case, or [Bring Your Own IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/dedicated-ip-byo.html) addresses. Once no longer assigned, this resource returns the IP to the [`sesDefaultDedicatedPool`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/managing-ip-pools.html), managed by AWS.

 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Sesv2DedicatedIpAssignment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/sesv2-dedicated-ip-assignment";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Sesv2DedicatedIpAssignment(this, "example", {
