# Data Source: aws_ssm_patch_baseline

Provides an SSM Patch Baseline data source. Useful if you wish to reuse the default baselines provided.

## Example Usage

To retrieve a baseline provided by AWS:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ssm-patch-baseline";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline(this, "centos", {
      namePrefix: "AWS-",
      operatingSystem: "CENTOS",
      owner: "AWS",
    });
  }
}

```

To retrieve a baseline on your account:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-ssm-patch-baseline";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsSsmPatchBaseline(this, "default_custom", {
      defaultBaseline: true,
      namePrefix: "MyCustomBaseline",
      operatingSystem: "WINDOWS",
      owner: "Self",
    });
  }
}

```
