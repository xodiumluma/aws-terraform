# Data Source: aws_dx_location

Retrieve information about a specific AWS Direct Connect location in the current AWS Region.
These are the locations that can be specified when configuring [`awsDxConnection`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection.html) or [`awsDxLag`](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_lag.html) resources.

~> **Note:** This data source is different from the [`awsDxLocations`](/docs/providers/aws/d/dx_locations.html) data source which retrieves information about all the AWS Direct Connect locations in the current AWS Region.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataAwsDxLocation } from "./.gen/providers/aws/data-aws-dx-location";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataAwsDxLocation(this, "example", {
      locationCode: "CS32A-24FL",
    });
  }
}

```
