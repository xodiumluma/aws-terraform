```release-note:bug
resource/aws_sqs_queue: Change `sqs_managed_sse_enabled` to `Computed` as newly created SQS queues use [SSE-SQS encryption by default](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-sqs-announces-server-side-encryption-ssq-managed-sse-sqs-default/). This means that Terraform will only perform drift detection of the attribute's value when present in a configuration
