```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_instance: Add `host_resource_group_arn` attribute; improve compatibility with launching instances in a host resource group using an AMI registered with License Manager. NOTE: Because we cannot easily test this functionality, it is best effort and we ask for community help in testing.
```

```release-note:note
resource/aws_instance: With the retirement of EC2-Classic, `aws_instance` has been updated to remove support for EC2-Classic
